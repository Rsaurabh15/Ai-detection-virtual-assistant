# AI-detection-Virtual Assistant

This project is a Python-based virtual assistant that allows users to interact through both text and speech.
It can perform various tasks, such as telling the current time, fetching weather information, playing music, and opening websites.
The assistant uses multiple Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, web scraping, and GUI interaction.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Accepts user commands through voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to the user with synthesized speech.
- **Weather Information**: Fetches real-time weather data for a specified location.
- **Time Query**: Tells the current time.
- **Web Interaction**: Opens popular websites like Google, YouTube, and Spotify.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- **Custom Commands**: Recognizes specific keywords to execute actions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-assistant.git
   cd virtual-assistant
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python GUI.py
   ```

## File Structure

- **GUI.py**: The main file that initializes the graphical user interface and handles user interactions.
- **action.py**: Contains the logic for processing user commands and triggering corresponding actions.
- **weather.py**: Fetches real-time weather data using web scraping.
- **speech_to_text.py**: Converts speech input into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **text_to_speech.py**: Converts text responses into speech using the `pyttsx3` library.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

## Modules and Libraries Used

1. **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface.
2. **speech_recognition**: For capturing and recognizing user voice input.
3. **pyttsx3**: For text-to-speech conversion.
4. **requests_html**: For web scraping to fetch weather data.
5. **webbrowser**: For opening websites.
6. **datetime**: For fetching the current date and time.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - Users can either type commands into the GUI or speak into the microphone.

2. **Command Processing**:
   - The `action.py` module matches the input with predefined commands and performs the corresponding action.

3. **Response**:
   - The assistant responds via text and/or speech and updates the GUI with the conversation history.

## Example Commands

- "What is your name?"
- "Hello"
- "Good morning"
- "Time now"
- "Play music"
- "Open Google"
- "Weather"
- "Shutdown"

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced NLP capabilities for understanding complex queries.
- Integrate with APIs for calendar, reminders, and to-do lists.
- Expand weather functionality to include forecasts and additional details.
- Add support for custom user-defined commands.
